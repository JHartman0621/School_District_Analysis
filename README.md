# School_District_Analysis
Using python to analyze school data.

This is definitely going to be a partial credit assignment for me. I spent over 12 hours on this challenge yet after re-running the analysis my numbers for Thomas High School and for the district are exactly the same. Clearly I took a wrong turn along the way (This challenge has a crazy large amount of tasks included).

I believe I completed the requirements for deliverable #1, and desever partial credit for deliverable #2. 

I am opting to not complete deliverable #3 since the data is identical so there aren't any changes to analyze & discuss.

I suspect I took a wrong turn when I needed to set all of the values to NaN for Thomas HS 9th grader math and reading scores. Or, just following that, I may have made an error when merging the data frames.

When I am able to obtain a tutor I would like to go over the following:

* Changing all the reading_score and math_score to NaN for Thomas High School 9th graders
* When I merge the dataframes, I may have done something wrong. How does one merge without having the different x and y columns?

Thank you for your help and for reading through all of this.
